Getting the Source
==================

The recommended way is to get the repos using git

  $ git clone https://github.com/dblia/type-inference.git


Building & Installing
=====================

Ofcourse, you need GHC installed in order to build and run the typeinfer 
tool because is written in Haskell. Once you have successfully setup your
haskell environment, run the following command to build the tool:

  $ ghc --make typeinfer.hs
  
Run as:

  $ ./typeinfer < input.txt
  
A couple of input examples is located under the testcases dir.
